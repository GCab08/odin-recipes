    <h3>What is Thanksgiving without Pecan Pie.</h3>
    <p>Learn how to make the great American classic Pecan Pie.</p>
    <p>A flaky all butter pastry with a perfectly set, soft custardy filling with beautiful pecans,
        this is arguably the mother of all pies.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>White flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>ice cold water</li>
        <li>Pecans</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Light corn syrup</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Bourbon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <h4>Pie Crust</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, salt and sugar in a food processor. Pulse twice.</li>
        <li>Scatter over butter. Pulse 5 times or until the largest pieces are the size of peas.</li>
        <li>Turn food processor on low and add 2.5 tbsp water, keep blitzing for 7 to 10 seconds until it forms crumbly clumps (see video). Pinch with your fingers - it should come together - if not, add 1/2 tbsp water until it does. Don't blitz longer than 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Turn out crumbs onto work surface, use hands to bring together into a ball then pat into a 1.5cm / 1/2" thick disc. Wrap in cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pecans</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) / 160C / 320F (fan / convection).</li>
        <li>Scatter 1 1/4 cups pecans on baking tray and bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until you smell them.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and roughly chop. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remaining 1 1/4 cups don't need toasting - they are for the top.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add remaining Filling ingredients and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir through chopped pecans.</li>
        <li>Pour into crust - it should fill it about 1 cm / 2/5" from the top (you may have excess if your pastry shrank).</li>
        <li>Top with whole pecans in desired pattern.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Baking</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pie in oven. Bake for 50 minutes, checking at 40 minutes, until it doesn't jiggle much when you shake it but the centre is still soft when you touch it</li>
        <li>It will be puffed and cracks will look extreme, but it will deflate as it cools. If your pastry / pecans are browning too quickly, cover with foil.</li>
    </ol>
